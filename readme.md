# Starting Plutus

## Run the backend fat jar directly
* I have already composed a fat jar and check into the branch fat jar. Download the jar
* Go to jar location and Run with cmd : 
```$xslt
    java -Dspring.profiles.active=h2 -jar plutus-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
* Please ensure port 8080 is free. 
* open to explore the Restful service exposed
```$xslt
    http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html#/account-controller 
```

* Logs will be generated in the logs folder located at the same root of the jar
## Backend Installation
* checkout the code from source.
* import into intellij(You mgiht need loombok plugin in intellij for the source code to work properly), ensure intellij import the maven dependecies
correctly. As the project is developed with my own machine, it might not be compatible with company PC
* Run "PlutusApplication"
* In-mem db should already be set up and the run should be smooth. In case you are facing databae error, kindly check application.properties

### Preloading of sample data
The program is designed to pre-load the dummy data (generated by java code) into the database , which feeds data to UI layer
Refer to **PlutusUtils** if you want to increase the amount of transactions generated

### System Health Info

```$xslt
    http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```


### Accessing in-mem h2 database

To minimize setup i use the in-mem db, once system bootup, use the following link to access
http://localhost:8080/h2-console

By default the db is purely in-mem, to change for file base, uncomment the following line and change to your **ABSOLUTE** path
```$xslt
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:C:/_appdev/source/plutus/data/plutusdb
```
